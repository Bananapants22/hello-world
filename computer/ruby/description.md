# Ruby
Ruby is general purpose, dynamic programming language.

# Example
Ruby code looks like this:
```ruby
puts 'Hi!'                   # Prints Hi! with a newline
print 'enter your name:'     # Prints enter your name: without a newline
name = gets.chomp            # Takes input and stores in in the variable name
puts "Hi! #{name}"           # Prints Hi! and the name that was input with a newline
```
