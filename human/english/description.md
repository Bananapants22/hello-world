English is a West Germanic language, descended from Early Modern English.

English is the main language in England, the United States, Australia and New Zealand, and is an official language in many others.

English looks like this (from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language):

```
English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and is now a global 
lingua franca. Named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to England, it ultimately 
derives its name from the Anglia (Angeln) peninsula in the Baltic Sea. It is closely related to the 
Frisian languages, but its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages, 
particularly Norse (a North Germanic language), as well as by Latin and French.
